# InstagramClone

## Overview
The **InstagramClone** is a frontend Android application developed as a university project to replicate the home screen of Instagram. Built using **Android Studio**, the app features a responsive UI with **horizontal and vertical ScrollViews** to mimic Instagram’s Stories and feed sections. The layout is designed using **RelativeLayout** and **LinearLayout** within fragments, providing a hands-on learning experience in combining Android layouts for a seamless user interface.

## Features
- **Instagram Home Screen**: Replicates the core UI of Instagram’s home screen, including Stories and feed sections.
- **Horizontal ScrollView**: Implements a horizontally scrollable Stories section for a native Instagram-like experience.
- **Vertical ScrollView**: Supports a vertically scrollable feed for browsing posts.
- **Fragment-Based UI**: Uses fragments to modularize the UI, with **RelativeLayout** and **LinearLayout** for precise and flexible design.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across various screen sizes with adaptive layouts.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java
- **UI Framework**: XML with AndroidX (RelativeLayout and LinearLayout)
- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **Target Platform**: Android (API 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop))
